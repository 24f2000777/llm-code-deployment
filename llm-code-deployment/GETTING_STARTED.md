# Getting Started - Complete Beginner's Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you set up and run your LLM Code Deployment system, even if you're completely new to this.

## ðŸŽ¯ What This System Does

This system:
1. âœ… Receives task requests (someone tells it to build an app)
2. âœ… Uses AI (LLM) to write the code automatically
3. âœ… Creates a GitHub repository
4. âœ… Deploys the app to GitHub Pages (makes it live on the web)
5. âœ… Notifies the evaluation server when done
6. âœ… Can update the app if asked (Round 2)

## ðŸš¦ Step-by-Step Setup (Absolute Beginner)

### Step 1: Install Software (15 minutes)

**1.1 Install Node.js**
- Go to: https://nodejs.org/
- Click the big green button on the left (LTS version)
- Download and install
- Keep clicking "Next" until it's done

**1.2 Install Git**
- Go to: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Download for your operating system
- Install with default settings

**1.3 Verify Installation**
Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):
```bash
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```
You should see version numbers. If you do, you're good!

### Step 2: Get Your API Keys (20 minutes)

**2.1 GitHub Token (Required)**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" â†’ "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it: "LLM Deployment"
4. Check these boxes:
   - âœ… All boxes under "repo"
   - âœ… workflow
   - âœ… admin:repo_hook
5. Click green "Generate token" button at bottom
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)
7. Paste it in a text file and save it somewhere safe

**2.2 LLM API Key (Required - Pick ONE)**

**OPTION A: AIPipe (FREE - Recommended for beginners)**
1. Go to: https://aipipe.io/
2. Sign up (free)
3. Go to dashboard
4. Copy your API token
5. Save it

**OPTION B: OpenAI (Paid, but very good)**
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/signup
2. Create account
3. Add payment method (costs ~$0.01-0.10 per task)
4. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
5. Create key, copy it, save it

**OPTION C: Anthropic Claude (Paid)**
1. Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Sign up and add payment
3. Get API key from dashboard

### Step 3: Create Your Project (10 minutes)

**3.1 Create Folder**
```bash
# Open terminal/command prompt and type:
mkdir llm-code-deployment
cd llm-code-deployment
```

**3.2 Initialize Project**
```bash
npm init -y
```

**3.3 Install Required Packages**
```bash
npm install express body-parser dotenv axios simple-git @octokit/rest fs-extra
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

This will take a few minutes. You'll see lots of text scrolling - that's normal!

**3.4 Create Folders**

**On Windows:**
```bash
mkdir src
mkdir src\api
mkdir src\generator
mkdir src\github
mkdir src\utils
mkdir test
mkdir logs
mkdir generated-repos
mkdir scripts
```

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
mkdir -p src/api src/generator src/github src/utils test logs generated-repos scripts
```

### Step 4: Add the Code Files (20 minutes)

Now you need to create each file with the code I provided above. Here's the checklist:

**Root directory files:**
- [ ] `.gitignore` - Copy from artifact above
- [ ] `.env` - Create empty, will fill in step 5
- [ ] `package.json` - Update with artifact above
- [ ] `index.js` - Copy from artifact above
- [ ] `setup.js` - Copy from artifact above
- [ ] `README.md` - Copy from artifact above
- [ ] `INSTALLATION.md` - Copy from artifact above
- [ ] `QUICKREF.md` - Copy from artifact above

**src/utils/ files:**
- [ ] `src/utils/logger.js`
- [ ] `src/utils/verifySignature.js`
- [ ] `src/utils/retryRequest.js`

**src/generator/ files:**
- [ ] `src/generator/llmClient.js`
- [ ] `src/generator/codeGenerator.js`

**src/github/ files:**
- [ ] `src/github/githubManager.js`

**src/api/ files:**
- [ ] `src/api/taskHandler.js`
- [ ] `src/api/server.js`

**test/ files:**
- [ ] `test/testEndpoint.js`

**How to create files:**
1. Open each file in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)
2. Copy the code from the artifacts I provided
3. Paste into the file
4. Save the file

### Step 5: Configure Your Settings (5 minutes)

**5.1 Run Setup Wizard**
```bash
node setup.js
```

**5.2 Enter Your Information:**
- Email: your-email@example.com
- Usercode: Make up a unique code like "student-12345"
- GitHub username: your GitHub username
- GitHub token: Paste the token from Step 2.1
- Choose LLM (1, 2, or 3): Pick the one you got a key for
- Paste your LLM API key
- Port: Just press Enter (uses default 3000)

**5.3 Manual Setup (if wizard doesn't work):**

Create a file called `.env` with this content:
```env
STUDENT_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
USERCODE=student-12345
GITHUB_TOKEN=paste-your-github-token-here
GITHUB_USERNAME=your-github-username
AIPIPE_TOKEN=paste-your-aipipe-token-here
PORT=3000
API_ENDPOINT_PATH=/api/task
LOG_LEVEL=info
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Step 6: Start Your Server! (2 minutes)

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
ðŸš€ Server is running!
Port: 3000
API Endpoint: http://localhost:3000/api/task
```

**ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Your server is running!**

### Step 7: Test It (5 minutes)

**7.1 Test Server Health**

Open browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000/health
```

You should see JSON with "status": "healthy"

**7.2 Run Automated Test**

Open a NEW terminal (keep the server running) and type:
```bash
npm test
```

This will:
- Send a test task
- Generate code with AI
- Create a GitHub repository
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Show you the results

**7.3 Check Your GitHub**

Go to your GitHub profile (https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME)
You should see a new repository called something like "test-hello-world"

**7.4 Check the Live Website**

The test will show you a URL like:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/test-hello-world/
```

Visit that URL - you should see your AI-generated webpage!

## âœ… Success Checklist

- [ ] Node.js installed
- [ ] Git installed  
- [ ] GitHub token obtained
- [ ] LLM API key obtained
- [ ] All files created
- [ ] `.env` configured
- [ ] Server starts successfully
- [ ] Test passes
- [ ] Repository created on GitHub
- [ ] Website is live on GitHub Pages

## ðŸŽ“ What to Do Next

### For Your Assignment

1. **Keep your server running** - Use `npm start`
2. **Submit your endpoint URL** to instructors
   - If running locally: `http://YOUR_IP:3000/api/task`
   - If deployed: Your cloud URL
3. **Wait for real tasks** - Instructors will send requests
4. **Monitor logs** - Check `logs/` folder for activity

### Making Your Server Accessible

Your server is currently only on your computer. To receive tasks from instructors, you need to:

**Option 1: Deploy to Cloud (Recommended)**
- Use Railway, Render, or Heroku (see QUICKREF.md)
- They provide a public URL automatically

**Option 2: Use ngrok (For Testing)**
```bash
# Install ngrok from ngrok.com
ngrok http 3000
# Copy the https URL it gives you
```

**Option 3: Use Your Computer's IP (Local Network Only)**
- Only works if instructors are on same network
- Find your IP: `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux)
- Use: `http://YOUR_IP:3000/api/task`

## ðŸ†˜ Common Problems & Solutions

### "Command not found"
**Problem:** System doesn't recognize `node`, `npm`, or `git`
**Solution:** Restart your terminal/command prompt after installing software

### "Port 3000 already in use"
**Problem:** Something else is using port 3000
**Solution:** Change PORT in `.env` to 3001 or 3002

### "Cannot find module"
**Problem:** Missing dependencies
**Solution:** 
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### "GitHub authentication failed"
**Problem:** Wrong token or expired
**Solution:** Generate a new GitHub token (Step 2.1)

### "OpenAI/Claude API error"
**Problem:** No credits or wrong key
**Solution:** Use AIPipe instead (it's free!)

### Server starts but test fails
**Problem:** Could be many things
**Solution:** Check logs:
```bash
cat logs/app-*.log
```
Look for "ERROR" messages

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Always check logs** when something goes wrong
2. **Test locally first** before deploying
3. **Keep your .env file secure** - never share it
4. **Use `npm run dev`** during development (auto-restarts on changes)
5. **Read error messages carefully** - they usually tell you what's wrong

## ðŸŽ‰ You're All Set!

Your LLM Code Deployment system is ready to:
- Receive tasks
- Generate code with AI
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Handle updates

Good luck with your project! ðŸš€
